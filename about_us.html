	<p>It is been said that one lives numerous lives, when one reads books. </p>
	<p>In today's world of speed, internet, television and malls, the habit of reading books has taken a hit. This can be attributed to the following reasons:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>No time to go browse through Book shops or Libraries.</li>
		<li>Lack of libraries in the vicinity</li>
		<li>Old library system with its difficulty to navigate and browse</li>
		<li>Books have become very expensive to purchase</li>
		<li>Advent of the Internet / TV as alternate sources of entertainment</li>
	</ol>
